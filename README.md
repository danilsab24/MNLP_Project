# MNLP_Project
This repository contains two projects developed for the *Multilingual Natural Language Processing (MNLP)* course (2025). Below is a detailed overview:

- **Homework 1** (`HW1` folder):  
  The objective of this project is to classify a given item (e.g., "pizza", "pasta", "cement") into one of the following cultural categories based on its cultural relevance and recognition:

  - **Cultural Agnostic (C.A.)**: The item is commonly known and used worldwide, and no specific culture claims ownership of it (e.g., "bridge", "potato", "car").

  - **Cultural Representative (C.R.)**: The item originates from a specific culture and/or is claimed by it, but is also known or used by other cultures or has similar counterparts (e.g., "spaghetti", "hamburger", "baozi").

  - **Cultural Exclusive (C.E.)**: The item is known and used exclusively within a specific culture and is explicitly claimed by that culture (e.g., "pasta alla gricia", "xiao longbao").

- **Homework 2**: *Work in Progress*
